            <p>Aundha Nagnath (Nageshwaram) is a Temple in Hingoli District in the state of Maharashtra, India, an important place of pilgrimage. The present temple is said to have been built by the Seuna (Yadava) dynasty and dates to the 13th century. The first temple is said to be from the time of the Mahabharata and is believed to have been constructed by Yudhishthira, the eldest of the Pandavas, when they were expelled for 14 years from Hastinapur. It has been stated that the temple building was seven-storeyed before it was sacked by Aurangzeb.</p>
